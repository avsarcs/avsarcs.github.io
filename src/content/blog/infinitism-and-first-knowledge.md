description: Klein fails to defend infinitism
---

Klein views infinitism as the only proper account of knowledge based on his claim that rejecting infinitism would inevitably end up violating at least one of two epistemic principles; namely the Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) and the Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA). He stipulates PAC and PAA as “intuitively plausible constraints on good reasoning,” (Klein, 1999, pg. 298).
The first of these principles, PAC, states that a belief cannot be involved in its own chain of justification. This is a simple requirement that circular reasoning is avoided. Consider the following reasoning:

1.	I know that there is a table in the world because my senses tell me so.

2.	My senses tell me so because there is a table in the world.

This reasoning cannot justify the belief B that there is a table in the world because, in order to accept (2) as justification for B, B would have to be justified in the first place; this implies a need for non-recurrence in any chain of justificatory reasons. Klein recognizes coherentism as a culprit of circular reasoning since it involves propositions appearing in their own justificatory chain in a large, coherent network of justifications. Hence, violating PAC, coherentism is unacceptable.

The second principle, PAA, states that if a person is justified in a belief B, they have a reason r1 for believing that B and, a reason r2 for believing that r1 and so on with each reason requiring its own reason (Klein, 1999, pg. 299). Consequently, no reason can be final without need of justification. Foundationalism holds that fundamental reasons in no need of further justification (or justifying themselves) lie as the bedrock of knowledge, hence should be rejected as violating PAA according to Klein. Furthermore, Klein asserts that some variations of coherentism are “closet foundationalism” since they hold “being a member of a coherent set of propositions” as a fundamental justification, requiring their rejection as well (Klein, 1999, pg. 298). With foundationalism violating PAA and coherentism violating PAC and possibly PAA, we are left with infinitism only as a viable explanation of epistemic justification.

Klein anticipates the Aristotelian objection to his argument that “if some knowledge is inferential, some is not inferential” (Klein, 1999, pg. 310). Klein claims that the existence of non-inferential knowledge is not incompatible with a structure of justificatory reasons as infinite. If we were completely ignorant at one point, maybe birth, and then had knowledge, we could not arrive at that knowledge through inference on some prior knowledge of a justificatory reason. As such, Klein grants that we could have beliefs unjustified by reasons. But he does not count these beliefs as “adult type human knowledge” (Klein, 1999, pg. 310) which he claims still requires reasons. Klein argues that we make the leap from ignorance to adult knowledge by discovering and grasping the reasons that justify our beliefs.

I claim that Klein’s response to the Aristotelian objection just doesn’t explain how a knowing adult came to grasp their first justificatory reason while transitioning from ignorance. The initial picture, we are assuming, is that we have certain beliefs that we provide no justifications for. This is the state of ignorance. Klein claims that we make the transition from ignorance to having adult knowledge only when there are justifications available for our beliefs (Klein, 1999, pg. 310) and we uncover those. Let’s say that there are several justifications available for our beliefs. My question is how do we, without having any foundationalist intuition or direct cognitive contact with the world, recognize that there are such justifications available? While we are in the state of ignorance, there could be an infinite number of false beliefs that we could mistakenly recognize as a justification for our beliefs; how are we initially able to distinguish beliefs that are acceptable as a justification, while recognizing others as false? The Aristotelian account can explain this by asserting that we have a starting non-inferential knowledge of the distinctions between what makes up a proper justification, while Klein’s picture remains unclear.  Therefore, I believe that Klein’s response to the Aristotelian objection is unsatisfactory.
