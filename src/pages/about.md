Hi there.. ðŸ‘‹

I am a CS major + philosophy minor (junior) in Bilkent University, Ankara.

I'll try to write quality content but there are absolutely zero promises. I am hoping to funnel some like-minded people from X here to read and think with me, to make some connections with similar interests, maybe even collaborate.

I aspire to those in the software community who call themselves "makers"; those with high creative energy and an eye for aesthetics. Those who can get excited about a vision and craft projects in their mom's basements with the same spirit and vigor as Tombo from Kiki's Delivery Service, crafting an airplane in his backyard.

(I guess some people got a similar sense of excitement from playing with legos during their childhood. I never did play with legos that much, if you don't mean the video game version.)

In my opinion, no one comes to this world to moneymax or careermax or statusmax etc. etc. The only thing that matters is creative freedom, and the extent to which you are able to indulge in it.

Let this be my little puddle of freedom on the internet.

See you soon.
